        I am a mechanical engineer and postdoctoral researcher working at the
        intersection of robotics, control theory, and data-driven modeling.
        I build reliable control and automation systems for medical and
        high-throughput applications, with a focus on robust and adaptive
        control, physics-informed machine learning, and real-time robotic
        platforms.
